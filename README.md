Welcome to **Play with Chemistry** – an interactive and dynamic journey through the elements! Dive into a puzzle inspired by the periodic table and explore the magic of chemistry in a fun, engaging way.

## Overview

Imagine a laboratory where elements come alive – where **Alkali Metals**, **Alkaline Earth Metals**, **Transition Metals**, and many more are ready for you to experiment with. This project transforms the periodic table into a puzzle, letting you start, pause, or shuffle through the elemental groups at your own pace.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:**  
  Play with the periodic table by categorizing elements from various groups like Noble Gases, Metalloids, and Actinides.

- **Dynamic Controls:**  
  Use the **Start**, **Pause**, and **Shuffle** options to control your gameplay and challenge your understanding of chemistry.

- **Educational & Fun:**  
  Perfect for students, educators, or anyone curious about the fundamental building blocks of matter.

- **Visually Engaging:**  
  Enjoy a clean and intuitive interface that brings chemistry to life in a playful format.
